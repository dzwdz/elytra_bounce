# Elytra Bounce / Elytra Hopping
Same mod, just I just modified the file `fabric.mod.json` to say to Fabric that this mod is compatible with any version of Minecraft  
Please credit the original creator of the original mod for making the code  
The original mod is on [GitHub](https://github.com/dzwdz/elytra_bounce) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/elytra-hopping)  
This mod is server-side, it means that if you install this mod on a server, you will not have to download it on the client
